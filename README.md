# Edwin Tan's Personal Website

This website is my personal portfolio, and I'll be continually refining it as I advance and demonstrate new skills. I've developed this application using a blend of technologies I've applied in my professional career and those I've been passionate about using in my personal projects. While I believe the website is already presentable, I consider it an ongoing project that I'll continuously enhance.

Some of the features and technologies may seem excessive, but this is a deliberate choice on my part. I'm eager to explore new technologies and ensure that this project is constructed in a sustainable manner. For instance, a substantial portion of the front-end code is not hard-coded, enabling the website to be data-driven and reducing the need for frequent code updates to refresh the content.


### Tech Stack
- Next.JS - I have never used a Next.JS in an actual project before so I decided to use it here and try out the new app router features
- React - A popular framework of choice for web development and something I use daily at my work
- TypeScript - Something I have picked up at my work and loved it due to its benefits
- TailWind - With so many CSS frameworks out there, I wanted to try exploring something I have not tried before and TailWind pairs really well with Next.JS
- RippleUI - A TailWind component library with TailWind
- GitHub Actions - My pipeline of choice to practice creating and understanding this unique area of web development.  Also something I currently use at my workplace
- Vercel - I have never used Vercel to host my projects until now and it is mind blowing how easy and simple it is to use.  I've integrated my CI/CD with Vercel to have a seemless deployment
- GraphQL - I have not had the opportunity to use this too much at my current workplace so I decided to incorporate it with my project
- Hasura - My GraphQL platform of choice since this is something I am familiar using from work
- S3 - I haven't used this service and I have some images I needed to store somewhere so I took this as an opportunity to learn some of the basics of this
- CloudFront - Also something I haven't used before and used in conjunction with S3 to speed up queries
